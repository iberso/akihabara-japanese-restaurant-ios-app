# akihabara-japanese-restaurant-ios-app

I made this application to fulfill my midterm exam assignments for iOS-based development courses.

Make a menu of food and drink orders at a restaurant
- Launch screen showing a restaurant logo.
- The first ViewController consists of 5 choices of food menus and 5 drinks and there is a unit price and quantity input, and a button to go to the calculation on the second page.
- The second page displays the selected menu with subtotal and grand total calculations that have been added with 10% VAT.
- Can go back to the start page to edit menu options.
- on the second page there is a confirmation button for finalizing menu orders.
